GiveMeARide is an academic project to explore the possibilities of 
coordinating a huge number of entities. The first example application is 
coordinating a taxi's fleet. Each taxi has a mobile phone and updates is location to the services on the cloud. 

A passenger asks a taxi ride using a mobile phone application. The COordination On Cloud (new acronyms here, COOC) service organizes which 
taxi driver should pick the passenger.
